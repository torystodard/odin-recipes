        <li>1 ¼ pounds ground beef </li>
        <li>¼ cup Italian-seasoned bread crumbs</li>
        <li>¾ tablespoon dried oregano, divided</li>

        <li>¾ tablespoon dried basil, divided</li>

        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 (6.5 ounce) cans tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 (6 ounce) can sliced mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) package spaghetti</li>
        <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste (Optional) </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Mix eggs and bread crumbs together in a bowl. Add ground beef. Add 1/2 of the oregano, garlic powder, black pepper, and basil. Mix well. Shape into meatballs that are about 1 inch in diameter.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium-low heat. Cook meatballs in the pan with onion until golden brown, 7 to 10 minutes. Add tomato sauce, tomato paste, mushrooms, and remaining oregano, garlic powder, black pepper, and basil. Simmer for about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Place spaghetti into a 9x13-inch baking pan and pour sauce evenly over the top. Top with Parmesan cheese and cover with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and and cheese is melted, about 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
